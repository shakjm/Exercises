Exercises that are done are listed as below.

1. KNN Classifier based on Adrian Rosebrock's Deep Learning textbook, with adjustments done to fit own files. (KNN-Classifier)
2. Neural Network (Simple 2input, 3 hidden layers and 2 output model) with backpropogation training. (Lost the Reference, will update)


# Tips for beginners like myself (Research Student with zero experience in Machine Learning)

1. Read articles on KDNuggets and datasciencecentral to familiarize yourself with some terms commonly used in the data science field.
2. Having difficulty in understanding research papers published? Not sure of the terms that are commonly used? Read Adrian Rosebrock's textbook to quickly familiarize yourself with the terms that are commonly used! Research papers will be much easier to understand. 
3. Computer Vision plays an important role (if you are dealing with images as I am), read textbooks on CV. It will help in understanding research papers, that uses terms like padding, strides and pooling. 
4. Maths is very important if you are prioritizing mathematical formulas to be implemented in the model. Fundamental understanding will help you understand the model much better for future applications.
5. Practice, practice and practice coding.
